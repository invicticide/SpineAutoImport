# Prerequisites

You must be running Unity 5.0+, 2D Toolkit 2.5+, and the latest version of the spine-tk2d runtime.

The spine-tk2d runtime was deprecated by Esoteric Software on March 15, 2015. Kickbomb Entertainment maintains a [branch](https://github.com/kickbomb/spine-tk2d) created from the last version of spine-tk2d. This is branch is self-contained: from a blank Unity project, you can simply install Kickbomb's spine-tk2d variant and the latest 2D Toolkit from the Unity Asset Store and you should be good to go.

# Installation

Create a folder called **SpineAutoImport** in your Unity project's **Assets** folder, and copy the contents of this repository into it.

# Quick Start

If you're already very familiar with Spine, this quick start may be all you need!

1. Set up your default sprite collection settings in Unity's Preferences menu, on the **Spine Import** page.
2. Create a folder in your Unity project which will contain all the assets relating to this Spine rig.
3. Export the skeleton from Spine, as JSON, into this folder.
4. Copy the images you used as attachments in Spine, into this folder.
5. Right-click the folder in Unity and choose **Spine->Import Folder (tk2d)**.
6. Appreciate the magic!

# Tips

* The importer searches all sub-folders of your **destination folder**, so you can organize that however you'd like. Personally, I like to keep all the exports from Spine in a **Source** folder, so only the imported game-ready assets sit at the root.
* You can import multiple skeletons at once. If the **destination folder** contains more than one skeleton JSON, each one will generate its own tk2dSpriteCollection and SkeletonDataAsset.
* You can import multiple folders at once by selecting them all, then right-clicking any one and choosing **Spine->Import Folder (tk2d)**.
* Any images present in the **destination folder** which are not referenced by any imported skeleton will be automatically cleaned up. (Note that the images are *deleted*, so make sure you're importing copies, not your originals!)
* Changes in the skeleton JSON are automatically applied and do NOT require re-executing the **Spine->Import Folder (tk2d)** command.
* Changes to existing image files do NOT require re-executing the import command.
* If you add or remove image files, you SHOULD re-execute the import command. This will update the existing tk2dSpriteCollection in-place, preserving existing references.

# Detailed Usage

If you have problems with the quick start, this section presents the same workflow in much more detail.

You should start by opening Unity's Preferences menu and setting up your default sprite collection settings on the **Spine Import** page. When the importer creates new sprite collections, they'll be created with these settings. You should only need to set this up once, since you'll generally want all sprite collections in your project to use the same settings.

With that done, and assuming you've already created a rig in [Spine](http://esotericsoftware.com), the first step to bringing it into Unity is to export the skeleton and its dependent image files into your Unity project. Create a **destination folder** in your project which will contain all the assets relating to this Spine rig. (When we're done, this folder will contain the skeleton and images exported from Spine as well as the imported SkeletonDataAsset and tk2dSpriteCollection to be used in Unity.)

Now that you have a **destination folder**, export the skeleton into it:

1. In the Spine editor, click the Spine logo in the top-left to open the main menu, then choose **Export**.
2. In the column on the left, under the **Data** heading, choose **JSON**.
3. In the **Export JSON** settings on the right, set the **Output folder** to your **destination folder** or any sub-folder inside it.
4. Set **Extension** to **.json**.
5. Set **Format** to **JSON**.
6. You can tick **Non-essential data** and/or **Pretty print** if you want a more human-readable export for debugging, but the importer will also work fine with one or both of these disabled.
7. Leave **Create atlas** *un-checked*.
8. Click the **Export** button at the bottom of the window.

Finally, you'll also need to copy over all the image files you used as attachments in Spine. Those images need to reside in your **destination folder** or any sub-folder inside it.

Now you should have something like this:

	Assets/
		YourDestinationFolder/
			skeleton.json
			image1.png
			image2.png
			image3.png
			...

Or if you're like me you might choose to organize all the exported stuff into sub-folders, which can make for a cleaner Unity project view:

	Assets/
		YourDestinationFolder/
			Source/
				skeleton.json
				images/
					image1.png
					image2.png
					image3.png
					...

It doesn't really matter, because the importer will search all sub-folders of your **destination folder** and automatically hook up everything it finds. And speaking of importing, let's do that now:

1. In Unity, right-click your **destination folder** and choose **Spine->Import Folder (tk2d)**.
2. Wait a moment. If you're importing a very complex skeleton and/or a lot of images, Unity may appear to stall; just give it a minute, and it should finish up just fine. (Maybe one day I'll put this behind a nice progress bar or something.)
3. Appreciate the magic!

You should now have a few new assets in your **destination folder**:

	Assets/
		YourDestinationFolder/
			YourDestinationFolder Atlas Data/ (folder)
			YourDestinationFolder Atlas (tk2dSpriteCollection)
			YourDestinationFolder SkeletonData (SkeletonDataAsset)

Note that the tk2dSpriteCollection and SkeletonDataAsset have been named after the folder you placed them in. Usually you'll name the folder after the character (or whatever else) this Spine rig represents, so in practice you might see something more like this:

	Assets/
		Player/
			Player Atlas Data/
			Player Atlas
			Player SkeletonData

To add this rig to your scene, right-click the generated SkeletonData asset and choose **Spine -> Spawn**. And you're done!
